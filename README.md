Form-Template-Search is a React app using React Hooks, Rest API from: https://front-end-task-dot-fpls-dev.uc.r.appspot.com/api/v1/public/task_templates and CSS for styling. Data from the API is displayed when page is loaded. Features include: Sorting by name, sorting by date, search, pagination and sorting by category. 

Due to time constraints, it isn't a 100% ready, but I will continue to work on it.

Please reach out if you would like to ask any questions on what I have done so far.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
